Station Analysis


Design a query to find the most active stations.

1) List the stations and observation counts in descending order.



2) Which station has the highest number of observations?


Hint: You may need to use functions such as func.min, func.max, func.avg, and func.count in your queries.



3) Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (tobs).



4) Filter by the station with the highest number of observations.



5) Plot the results as a histogram with bins=12.
